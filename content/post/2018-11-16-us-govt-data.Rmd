# Principal Statistical Agency Programs

Inspiration and primary source for all of this information: [Statistical Programs of the United States Government Fiscal Year 2017](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/information_and_regulatory_affairs/statistical-programs-2017.pdf)


"The Federal Statistical System of the United States is the decentralized network of federal agencies which produce data about the people, economy, natural resources, and infrastructure of the United States." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Statistical_System_of_the_United_States)) 

I recently got the opportunity to visit the offices of the [Committee on National Statistics](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/dbasse/cnstat/index.htm) and I realized I had no idea just how much statistical work the Federal government does. Before this, the only statistical agency I really knew about was the Census Bureau. Based on my complete and total ignorance about all of the work done and data collected by the U.S. federal government, I decided to compile together as many sources of data as I could. Wherever possible, I tried to find APIs. This list is also probably not exhaustive. There is also way more data from state and local governments on [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), but I have not found this site to be particularly helpful when just looking for possible interesting data sources. It's better for very specific searches in my opinion. 

These 13 principal agencies are crucial to collecting data on the population and resources of the United States. They "provide critical support for policymaking, program management, and evaluation." Two of the 13 are independent: the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), a part of the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Office of Research, Evaluation, and Statistics (ORES), a part of the Social Security Administration (SSA). 

(If you're exhausted by the alphabet soup already, I suggest you stop reading....)

The report linked at the top contains descriptions of every agency and every statistical program. It also links to every program's website and provides employment data tables for the 13 principal agencies. Below, the numbers (x/y) are x = the number of statisticians employed and y = the number of full-time employees in the agency as of 2017.

# Other Federal Statistical Programs, by Department 

Of the fifteen US federal government departments, fourteen have additional statistical programs (outside of the 13 principal statistical agencies), and there are even more programs in independent agencies. There are 115 of these statistical programs in total (yes, I counted them). For each one, I just link to the closest thing to a data website I could find.

# What did I learn? 

- Just Google "search term" + gov + data + api. You'll probably find what you're looking for. 
- data.gov is not super useful unless you know exactly what you're looking for. There's just too much data! 
- There are a surprising number of federal agencies and/or programs putting their work on Github. Pretty exciting! 
- Get one API key for many .gov APIs: https://api.data.gov/
- The Open Data Executive Order is pretty great: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-
