## A no-so-great graphic

It's been snowing a lot lately in Iowa, so someone sent me [this tweet](https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines/status/1097357137158828032) about just how much snow we've been getting. Instead of getting shocked at the snow, I was shocked at the data visualization.

Why is this graphic not so great? Mostly, the double y-axis is very misleading. On 1/18, it looks like we got more snow in one day than we did all winter! So, with another snowy day again today, I decided to re-make it without the dual y-axes. 


## Making a better graphic

The [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/dmx/) takes in data from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/). So, I went searching for an R package for getting NOAA data into R. Luckily, [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rnoaa_tutorial/) has one!  It's called `rnoaa`. What follows is how I got the data and re-created the graphic. 

First, attach the necessary packages. 

```{r getdata}
# install.packages("rnoaa")
library(rnoaa)
library(tidyverse)
```


Then, get an [API token](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token) for the NOAA APIs. (Mine took about 20 minutes to come through.) Once you have that, set it up in your R session with `options()`: 

```{r setkey, eval=FALSE}
options(noaakey = "YOUR_KEY")
```

Next, find the Des Moines weather station(s) that will have the recorded data we want (historical daily snowfall). 

```{r getdsm, eval = FALSE}
# all stations with historical data
stat <- ghcnd_stations()
```

```{r getdsmforreal, echo = FALSE}
# all stations with historical data
stat <- read_csv("dat/stations.csv")
```

```{r getdsm2}
head(stat)
stat %>% filter(str_detect(name, "MOINES")) %>% # look for "des moines"
  arrange(first_year, desc(last_year)) %>% # make sure the years we want are covered (1981-2010, 2018-2019)
  filter(element == "SNOW") # we need snowfall data

dsm_info <- stat %>% filter(str_detect(name, "MOINES")) %>% 
  arrange(first_year, desc(last_year)) %>% 
  filter(element == "SNOW") %>% slice(3) # 3rd row is actually DSM, IA, and has 70+ years of data
dsm_id <- dsm_info %>% pull(id) # get the ID for this weather station
```

After a few failed attempts, and reading the [`rnoaa` documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnoaa/rnoaa.pdf), I decided that the best data source would be the Global Historical Climatology Network daily weather data. These data are documented [here](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt). The `ghcnd()` function gets all weather data for a particular station.  

```{r gethistdat, eval = FALSE}
hist_dsm_data <- ghcnd(dsm_id, refresh = TRUE)
head(hist_dsm_data)
```

```{r gethistdatforreal, echo=FALSE}
hist_dsm_data <- read_csv("dat/dsm_hist_weather.csv")
head(hist_dsm_data)
```

And now we corral the data for the visualization! We need (in inches): 

1. Daily snowfall amounts for the current winter
2. Historical average daily snowfall amounts for the 1981-2010 winters
3. Cumulative amounts of 1 and 2. 

The data are very wide, with 3 columns for each day of the month. 

```{r gethistdat2}
# make wide data long 
wide_to_long <- hist_dsm_data %>% filter(element=="SNOW") %>%  # just want snowfall totals
  select(year, month,starts_with("VALUE")) %>% # per documentation, VALUE# indicates the day of the month 
  gather(day, fall_mm, VALUE1:VALUE31) %>% # go from wide to long
  mutate(day = parse_number(day)) %>% # convert day to a number
  filter(!is.na(day)) # get rid of days that are missing/don't exist
head(wide_to_long)
# get winter data
winter_data <- wide_to_long %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::make_date(year = year, month = month, day = day)) %>% # create an actual date column
  arrange(date) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(fall_mm)) %>% # remove missings e.g. for February 30th 
  filter(month %in% c(11, 12, 1, 2))# only want winter months
head(winter_data)
# get cumulative totals
snow_data_hist <- winter_data %>% 
  mutate(year2 = ifelse(month %in% c(1,2), year-1, year)) %>% # create another year variable to group by 
  arrange(date) %>%                                           
  group_by(year2) %>% # so we can get cumulative snowfall in a winter season, not in a calendar year.
  mutate(fall_mm_cum = cumsum(fall_mm)) # compute cumulative snowfall 
head(snow_data_hist)

# get date ranges to match original plot
avg_81_10 <- filter(snow_data_hist, year2 %in% 1981:2010)  

head(avg_81_10)

# compute daily averages over the 30 year period
snow_data_avg <- avg_81_10 %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(day, month) %>% 
  mutate(avg_c_sum = mean(fall_mm_cum), avg_day_mm = mean(fall_mm)) 

# make sure date ranges match data available for 2019
snow_data_avg2 <- snow_data_avg %>% select(month, day, avg_c_sum, avg_day_mm) %>% 
  unique() %>% filter(month != 2 | !(month == 2 & day >16))

thisyear <- filter(snow_data_hist, year2 == 2018)

head(thisyear) 


thisyear %>% left_join(snow_data_avg2) %>% head() # combine historical data with this year's data

```

Finally, re-do the plot with a single y-axis. I also added daily average snowfall in red to compare the daily totals with this year's daily snowfall. 

```{r redoplot, out.width='80%', fig.align="center"}
p <- thisyear %>% left_join(snow_data_avg2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_c_sum*0.0393701, color = "1981-2010 Normal Snowfall"), size = 1.5)  + # multiply by 0.0393701 to convert mm to in
  geom_line(aes(y = fall_mm_cum*0.0393701, color = "2018-19 Total Snowfall"), size = 1.5) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = date, xend = date, y = 0, yend = fall_mm*0.0393701, color ="2018-19 Daily Snowfall"), size = 1.5) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = date, xend = date, y = 0, yend = avg_day_mm*0.0393701, color ="1981-2010 Average Daily Snowfall"), size = 1.5, alpha = .7) + 
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Snowfall (in)", title = "2018-19 Snowfall in Des Moines") + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 weeks", date_labels = "%m/%d") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:7*5, position = "right") +  
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_manual(name = "", values = c("2018-19 Daily Snowfall" = "#00B0F0",
                                           "1981-2010 Normal Snowfall" = "#00B050",
                                           "2018-19 Total Snowfall" = "navy",
                                           "1981-2010 Average Daily Snowfall" = "#71e8a7"), 
                     guide = guide_legend(nrow = 2)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", hjust = .5)) 
p
``` 

So, what do you think? 


<img src="/post/2019-02-18-redoing-graphs_files/nwsplot.png" alt="" width="80%"/>

or

```{r sidebyside, fig.show='hold', out.width='80%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
p
```


### Addendum 

Today, I learned different having a different `geom_*`s in each facet panel is a thing! 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d wonder about putting the daily snow fall in a different facet and using scales = “free” (different geoms in different facets is a cool trick that I don’t think enough people know about)</p>&mdash; Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1098581656997425154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2019</a></blockquote>

My solution. Thanks to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7903972/can-you-specify-different-geoms-for-different-facets-in-a-ggplot) StackOverflow question. 

```{r facetgeoms, out.width='100%', fig.align="center"}

snowdata2 <- snowdata2 %>% 
  mutate(type2 = recode(type, fall_mm = "Daily", fall_mm_cum = "Cumulative Snowfall", 
                        avg_c_sum = "Cumulative Snowfall", avg_day_mm = "Daily"),
         in_snow = mm_snow * 0.0393701)
head(snowdata2)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = snowdata2 %>% filter(type2 == "Cumulative Snowfall"), aes(x = date, y = in_snow, color = type), size = 1.5) +

  facet_wrap(~type2, nrow = 1, scales = "free_y" )


ggplot() +

  facet_grid(type2~., space = "free", scales = "free_y")
