Hi, I'm Samantha Tyner. Most people call me Sam. I'm an applied statistician and data scientist, with a wide range of skills and experiences. I became a statistician because **I want to use data to make a difference**. 

Currently, I'm the inaugural 2019-20 AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Office of Survey Methods Research. Previously, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence](https://forensicstats.org/) at Iowa State University. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from [Iowa State](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) in 2017 where I worked with [Heike Hofmann](https://github.com/heike). 

**I'm also on the job hunt!** I am seeking a DC-based or 100% remote role in the government or non-profit space. I am passionate about:  
- Using data science for social good
- Data visualization
- Communicating science & statistics to a general audience. Check out my blog posts and my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/sctyner/status/1144729288345825286?s=20) for examples!
- Using R and other open source software. See my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sctyner)
- Building up inclusive R user & data science communities. 
    * I am an active member of [R-Ladies DC](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dc/), and the co-founder of [R-Ladies Ames](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-ames/)
    * I am the co-creator of the [Uncoast Unconference](http://uuconf.rbind.io/), a community-building hackathon-style event for R users in middle America.
