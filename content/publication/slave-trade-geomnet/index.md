# Abstract.
abstract = "The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, hosted by Emory University, contains information on nearly 35,000 voyages of slave ships from 1514 - 1866 between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The entire database contains 279 variables with information on the 34,948 voyages. While the website dedicated to this data contains a dashboard to subset and visualize the data, I wanted to view the data in a new way. I use the geomnet package because I wanted to show that the user can visually explore the data in a way that leaves them with a deeper understanding of the structure of the slave trade. I start by visualizing all of the data I pulled from the database on one map, then I look at different subsets of it, and I end with a much deeper understanding of the slave trade and its impact on the world."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
