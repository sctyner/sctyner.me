# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper explores three different approaches to visualize networks by building on the grammar of graphics framework implemented in the ggplot2 package. The goal of each approach is to provide the user with the ability to apply the flexibility of ggplot2 to the visualization of network data, including through the mapping of network attributes to specific plot aesthetics. By incorporating networks in the ggplot2 framework, these approaches (1) allow users to enhance networks with additional information on edges and nodes, (2) give access to the strengths of ggplot2, such as layers and facets, and (3) convert network data objects to the more familiar data frames."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary = "A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items can be tried on."
