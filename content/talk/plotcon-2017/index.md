abstract: "Model visualization is a novel tool that can help us better understand advanced statistical analyses. In this talk, I'll apply the principles of model-vis to social networks and their models. Some questions I propose to answer are, What exactly is the 'data space' of a social network and how can we view models for social networks in that data space? How can we explore multiple network models in a collection simultaneously? And, what visualizations are available to us to better understand the algorithms used to fit these often incredibly complicated models to an observed social network?"
