abstract: "Reproducibility, the ability to reproduce oneâ€™s results from the same data and code, and efficiency go hand-in-hand for statistical analyses. The more efficient your code, the easier it is to reproduce your results. When collaborating with others, reproducible and efficient code is even more vital.  In R and RStudio, there are many tools available to increase both your efficiency and your reproducibility. In this talk, I will focus on two families of tools: the rmarkdown and the tidyverse suites of R packages. Rmarkdown and related packages make it easy to conduct reproducible research, and the tidyverse programming paradigm helps you write more efficient R code. You will leave this talk with knowledge of at least one new R package to add to your R toolbox and make your research better."
